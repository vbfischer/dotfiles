# My Dotfiles
## dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles which I have mostly curated from various sources. They are largely inspired by [the following blog post for the most part](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

It is managed by [Homesick][https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick]. It is mainly organized as a "castle" in Homesick, and is installed in the .homesick/repos folder.

## Install
First will need to install homesick:

    gem install homesick
    homesick clone vbfischer/dotfiles
    homesick symlink
    
## Resources
The following are resources I used when making my dotfiles:
* [GitHub's page on dotfiles][http://dotfiles.github.io] is used as a starting point.
* [Zach Holman's dotfiles][https://github.com/holman/dotfiles] was probably my primary source.
* [Mathias Bynen's dotfiles][https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles] was equally important. 
* [oh-my-zsh][https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh] provides most functionality.

I tried to leave comments with where they came from, but its likely in my cut/paste/etc it might have gotten removed. If you see something, let me know.
