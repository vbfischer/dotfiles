And Solarized manages to achieve this while still\nlooking beautiful.\n\nHowever, the dark blue \"in the shade of a tree\" background (as well as the yellow\nmorning-sun variant) break this neutrality. Lunarized fixes it by completely\ndesaturating the base colors as well as lowering each of their brightnesses by 15%.\nPlain text has also been bumped from the base0 to base1 color to compensate.\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82187473/Screenshots/Lunarized-Zsh.png)\n\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82187473/Screenshots/Lunarized-CSS.png)\n\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82187473/Screenshots/Lunarized-Vim.png)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### To get the Atom package:\n\n* Bring up Settings via `cmd-,`\n* Go to the Themes page\n* Search for Lunarized and install\n\n### To get the Vim colorsheme:\n\nWith [pathogen]:\n\n    cd ~/.vim/bundle\n    git clone https://github.com/aclissold/lunarized-syntax\n\nWithout pathogen:\n\n    mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors\n    cd ~/.vim/colors\n    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aclissold/lunarized-syntax/master/lunarized.vim\n\n\n[Solarized]: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized\n[pathogen]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\n",
