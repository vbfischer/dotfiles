With Jekyll Manager you can now do all your Jekyll Development without leaving your editor!\n\n![Jekyll Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arcath/jekyll-atom/master/Jekyll-Manager.gif)\n\n## Functions\n\n### Open the layout for the current file\n\nWhen triggered this function looks through your file for `layout: foo` and then opens `LAYOUTS_DIR/foo.LAYOUT_FORMAT`\n\n### Open the include for the cursor position\n\nWhen triggered this function opens up the include for the current tag. For example if you had `{% include snippet.html %}` Atom would open `INCLUDES_DIR/snippet.html`\n\n### Create a new Post\n\nWhen triggered this function brings up a popup at the top of the screen for you to type in the title of your new post e.g. `Something Really Cool!` (on the date 2/4/2014). When you submit the form a new file of `POSTSDIR/2014-04-02-something-really-cool.POST_FORMAT` will be created with a very basic front matter and opened on the screen.\n\n### Open Config\n\nOpens `_config.yml`\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n`Cmd-Alt-L` Open the layout for the current file\n\n`Cmd-Alt-J` Create a new post\n\n`Cmd-Shift-I` Open include\n\n## Snippets\n\nThere are a load of snippets provided by this plugin, please check the settings pane in atom for a full list.\n\n# Contributing\n\nFeel free to fork this repo and submit changes!\n\nWhen you fork Jekyll-Atom please:\n\n1.
